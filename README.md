# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! 
This is a simple and fun game where two players can challenge each other to a game of strategy. 
The goal of the game is to place three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.
Start by choosing your symbol, either X or O, and then take turns marking spaces on the game board.
The first player to get three in a row wins the game.
